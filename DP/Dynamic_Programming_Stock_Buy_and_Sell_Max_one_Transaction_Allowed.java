 * # Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
 *
 *   Q. Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days.
 *      The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different
 *      days when at most, one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If
 *      it is impossible to make a profit, then return 0.
 *
 *      Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
 *   Ex.
 *      Input : prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
 *      Output: 8
 *      Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9.
 *                   Hence, the profit is 8.
