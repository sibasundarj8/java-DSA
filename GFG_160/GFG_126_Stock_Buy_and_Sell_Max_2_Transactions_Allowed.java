 * # Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max 2 Transactions Allowed
 * 
 *   Q. In daily share trading, a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day. If the trader 
 *      is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share 
 *      trader could have made.
 * 
 *      You are given an array of prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day. Note that 
 *      the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).
 *   Ex.
 *      Input: prices[] = [10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80]
 *      Output: 87
 *      Explanation: 
 *             Trader will buy at 10 and sell at 22. 
 *             Profit earned in the 1st transaction = 22-10 = 12. 
 *             Then he buys at 5 and sells at 80. 
 *             Profit earned in the 2nd transaction = 80-5 = 75. 
 *             Total profit earned = 12 + 75 = 87.
