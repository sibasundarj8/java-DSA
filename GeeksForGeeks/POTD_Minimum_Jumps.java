/*
 *   Q. Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Each array element represents the maximum
 *      length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x,
 *      then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x. Find the minimum number of jumps to reach
 *      the end of the array starting from the first element. If an element is 0, then you cannot
 *      move through that element.
 *
 *      Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
 *
 *      Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation:
 *                  First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here we jump to
 *                  5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
