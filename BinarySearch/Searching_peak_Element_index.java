 *   Q. A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 *      Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 *      If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 *      You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always
 *      considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 *      You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *    Example :
 *              Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 *              Output: 5
 *              Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
 *                           element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
